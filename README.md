- Chatroom on hip chat: *EarthIssueTracker (Amsterdam)*

## Preliminary notes:

- That Project Card becomes the tool for judging your app at the end!
- The goal is to build a prototype of a solution to a problem related to climate change. 
- All projects should address one of the 15 Global Challenges

### Applicable Global Challenges

1. **Public Awareness**
How might we increase overall understanding of the science and facts of climate change, to gain a critical mass of public awareness and support for strong action on climate change?

2. **Personal Impact**
How might we help individuals and families understand their personal impact and carbon footprint, shift to climate-friendly behaviours and reduce carbon-intensive consumption? 

- Empowerment of children
- More effective ways for charities to engage volunteers
- Mobilising supporters in climate change actions
- New tools to get activists' voices heard

3. **Digital Activism**
What digital tools can we give to savvy activists and campaigners that will unlock the potential to create powerful movements for climate action? 
Led by 350

5. **International Negotiations**
What tools might we build to better facilitate effective international negotiations towards creating strong international agreements and commitment?

9. **Ecosystems and Nature**
How might we ensure the protection and restoration of natural, resilient ecosystems and conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change? 
Pre-event Webcast: Wednesday 10 Sep at 08.00 PDT / 11.00 EDT / 16.00 BST / 17.00 CEST with Fauna & Flora International

10. **Collaboration**
How might we facilitate more effective collaboration and communication between NGOs, public sector, private sector and communities in sudden onset disasters?

11. **Consumer Behaviour**
How can we influence and encourage climate-friendly consumption choices at all levels of society?

12. **Energy production**
How might we stimulate and support a rapid transition to a low-carbon energy production and distribution system, whether at the international, national or community level?

13. **Responsible Finance**
How might we encourage responsible finance: investment into renewable energy and divestment from fossil fuels? 
Pre-event Webcast: Monday 8 Sep at 08.00 PDT / 11.00 EDT / 16.00 BST / 17.00 CEST with WWF

14. **Sustainable Business and Energy Efficiency**
How might we encourage a step change in how businesses use resources throughout their supply chain and accelerate the transition to a circular economy? 
Pre-event Webcast: Thursday 11 Sep at 07.00 PDT / 10.00 EDT / 15.00 BST / 16.00 CEST with Forum for the Future

15. **Reforestation**
How can we reduce deforestation and stimulate massive reforestation? 
Pre-event Webcast: Wednesday 10 Sep at 10.00 PDT / 13.00 EDT / 18.00 BST / 19.00 CEST / 20.00 EEST / 22.30 IST with WeForest and World Resources Institute




### Projects will be assessed according to the following criteria:

* **Impact (double-weighted)**: how much potential does it have to make a significant contribution to addressing the specific climate problem it is aimed at?
* **Foundations** - is the project based on solid foundations of best available scientific, economic and behavioural knowledge and evidence?
* **Portability** - to what extent can the project be replicated or adapted for different countries or regions to have a global impact?
* **Distribution** - is there a realistic route to delivering this project to those who need it? e.g. via an NGO partner or set of pilot users?
* **Sustainability** - is there a feasible model for ongoing development of the project and does the team show a strong desire to see the project through?
* **Innovation** - how genuinely novel or creative is the approach? does the project do something not previously possible or available?

# Earth Issue Tracker

- combine top-down and bottom-up activism
- focus on positive: you have a choice
- want to address bigger issues: change political decisions and company behaviour

- people don't understand what they can do about climate change
- say I have a free weekend, want to help local project
- or only work online as an expert, help breakdown big problems into actionable things

- user stories as a way to get subtasks

- acute problems
- meta issues, linking to sub issues


## Help user deciding where to put his action

"people like having the ability to choose, but don't like to choose"

- think supermarket: having separate sections
- what can you do? how much time, which skills

### Questionaire

"How can I find what I can contribute too"

- Ask for time constraint
- Find skills/interests (from social networks)

## Why engage in this project

- personal connection
- learning experience
- crowdfunded rewards?


### Rewards, incentives

- likes, votes
- offer help
- did something quantifiable (planted tree)
- introduced a person


## Bug nr. 1

- we could have a bug #1 'we are screwed', like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1

## Focus on positive

- Show success stories: pick out the gems
- Results: cleaned up a park

## Earth Hour Climate Wiki

https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/idea/53f5c59eb58be22105cf8a00

A lot of the information and data relating to climate change is out there **but simply not centralized, ordered and accessible, not media friendly, not perceived as relevant for people or difficult to understand**. Often people won't know where to look, and (time poor) campaigners and community organisations will often have to spend a lot of time researching and gathering data for local campaigns from many different places, organisations, websites.

As campaigners or advocates we need it to be in one place and ordered. We need to encourage people to engage with it and share it.
