- Chatroom on hip chat: *EarthIssueTracker (Amsterdam)*

## Preliminary notes:

- That Project Card becomes the tool for judging your app at the end!
- The goal is to build a prototype of a solution to a problem related to climate change. 
- All projects should address one of the 15 Global Challenges (**3. Digital Activism**)

Projects will be assessed according to the following criteria:

* **Impact (double-weighted)**: how much potential does it have to make a significant contribution to addressing the specific climate problem it is aimed at?
* **Foundations** - is the project based on solid foundations of best available scientific, economic and behavioural knowledge and evidence?
* **Portability** - to what extent can the project be replicated or adapted for different countries or regions to have a global impact?
* **Distribution** - is there a realistic route to delivering this project to those who need it? e.g. via an NGO partner or set of pilot users?
* **Sustainability** - is there a feasible model for ongoing development of the project and does the team show a strong desire to see the project through?
* **Innovation** - how genuinely novel or creative is the approach? does the project do something not previously possible or available?
